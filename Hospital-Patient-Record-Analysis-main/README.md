# **Hospital Patient Records Analysis Using Power BI**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes synthetic patient data from Massachusetts General Hospital (2011-2022) to uncover trends in:  
- Patient admissions and readmissions  
- Hospital stays and associated costs  
- Insurance coverage for medical procedures  
- Common medical conditions and diagnoses  

### **Dataset Overview**  
The dataset includes five key tables:  
- **Patients** – Demographic information (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, etc.).  
- **Encounters** – Hospital visits, associated costs, and payer details.  
- **Procedures** – Medical procedures performed, along with costs and descriptions.  
- **Payers** – Insurance provider details.  
- **Organizations** – Information on hospitals/clinics.  

## **Problem Statement**  
Hospitals handle vast amounts of patient data, making it challenging to:  
✅ Identify trends in **admissions and readmissions**.  
✅ Assess the **average length of hospital stays**.  
✅ Optimize **financial strategies** through cost analysis.  
✅ Evaluate **insurance coverage** for medical procedures.  

## **Data Source**  
The dataset was sourced from **Maven Analytics**, a platform for real-world analytics projects.

  - **Patient Demographics & Conditions**  
 -Used **charts, tables, and KPIs** to provide clear data insights.  

## Key Insights

**Admissions & Readmissions: High Readmission Burden with Minimal Stay**

Out of **974 patients admitted**, a striking **854 were readmitted**, suggesting potential lapses in discharge planning or care continuity.  
Despite the high volume of patient flow, the **average length of stay was only 0.30 days**, indicating quick turnover or low-acuity admissions.  
Each visit, however, incurred an **average cost of $3.64K**, making even short stays financially significant.

**Insurance Coverage: Medicare Leads in Financial Responsibility**

Out of **14,000 procedures covered by insurance**, **Medicare accounted for the highest total payments — $19M**.  
This highlights Medicare as a dominant payer in the system and a key contributor to revenue, underlining the importance of maintaining compliance and outcome quality for this segment.

**Patient Demographics: Aging Population, Concentrated Geography**

The majority of patients were in the **85–104 age group (368 patients)**, while the **25–44 age group** represented the smallest segment (**106 patients**), showing a skew toward elderly care demand.  
**White patients comprised 69.82%** of the total, followed by **Black (16.74%)**, **Asian (9.34%)**, and **Hispanic (19.61%)** populations.  
Gender distribution was nearly even: **Male (50.72%)**, **Female (49.28%)**.  
**Married patients made up 80.49%**, which may reflect access to caregiver support or family-based care decisions.  
Geographically, **Boston alone contributed 541 patients**, significantly more than surrounding cities like Quincy, Cambridge, Revere, and Chelsea.

**Patient Encounters: Heavy Reliance on Outpatient Services**

The healthcare system saw **12.5K ambulatory visits**, significantly higher than **1.1K inpatient admissions**, indicating that most care was delivered in an outpatient setting.  
The most frequent encounter was **"Encounter for problem procedure" (4.3K cases)** — suggesting recurring complications or issues related to previous interventions that required follow-up care.

**Diagnoses & Conditions: Prevalence of Chronic Illness, Documentation Gaps**

**Chronic conditions (1.7K cases)** and **hyperlipidemia (1.6K)** were the most commonly reported health issues, reflecting ongoing demand for long-term management.  
**Normal pregnancy (1.3K)** also featured prominently, indicating consistent maternal care activity.  
At the lower end, **sinusitis and asthma** were among the least recorded, with just **100 cases each**.  
Notably, **19.5K diagnoses were labeled “Unknown”**, pointing to serious gaps in data capture and documentation, which can undermine decision-making, reporting accuracy, and operational planning.

## Strategic Recommendations

**Address High Readmission Rates Through Post-Discharge Intervention**

With over 87% of admitted patients returning for care, there's a clear need to strengthen discharge planning and follow-up care. Introducing post-discharge call programs, remote monitoring for high-risk patients, and structured care transitions could reduce unnecessary readmissions while improving patient outcomes and reducing costs.

**Enhance Financial Oversight of Medicare-Covered Patients**

Given that Medicare contributes the largest share of insurance payments ($19M), continuous monitoring of outcomes and billing compliance for this segment is critical. Developing a focused care model for Medicare patients can ensure consistent reimbursement, minimize claim rejections, and support long-term financial sustainability.

**Expand Geriatric Care Services and Resource Allocation in High-Demand Areas**

The 85–104 age group represents the largest patient segment, and Boston accounts for the highest patient volume. These two factors combined suggest a strong case for scaling up specialized geriatric services and concentrating operational resources in the Boston region to meet demand efficiently.

**Investigate Repeated Outpatient Procedures to Reduce Procedural Errors**

The high volume of ambulatory visits and repeat "problem procedure" encounters signals a potential quality gap in outpatient treatment. Conducting root cause analyses on frequently recurring procedures can help identify areas for provider retraining, process improvement, or patient education, ultimately lowering repeat visits and operational strain.

**Improve Diagnostic Data Accuracy to Strengthen Analytics and Reporting**

The presence of 19.5K "Unknown" diagnosis records reflects a critical breakdown in clinical documentation. Investing in training for clinical staff, implementing system-level checks during data entry, and integrating decision support tools can dramatically improve data integrity and enable more reliable reporting and performance tracking.

**Design Preventive Health Campaigns Around Chronic Illness and Maternal Care**

With chronic conditions and pregnancy ranking high among diagnoses, focused preventive health programs can reduce avoidable complications and hospital visits. Educational outreach, early screening initiatives, and community partnerships can improve health literacy and long-term outcomes for these patient groups.

**Bridge the Care Gap Among Younger Adults and Underrepresented Ethnic Groups**

The low engagement of the 25–44 age group and underrepresentation of Hispanic and Asian populations may indicate access barriers or unmet needs. Community-focused engagement strategies and multilingual outreach can help close these gaps, ensuring more equitable service delivery across all demographics.

        IF ( 
            CALCULATE ( COUNT(encounters[Id]), ALLEXCEPT(encounters, encounters[Patient]) ) > 1, 
            1, 
            0

            CALCULATE ( COUNT(encounters[Id]), ALLEXCEPT(encounters, encounters[Patient]) ) > 1, 
            1, 
            0 
        )
    )
RETURN
    ReadmittedPatients

  - **Procedure Insurance Coverage** Procedure Insurance  coverage = CALCULATE(COUNT(encounters[Id]), encounters[PAYER_COVERAGE]>0)

## **Conclusion** 

📌 The hospital **primarily serves elderly, White, and non-Hispanic patients**, with most being married.  
📌 **Boston is the main patient hub**, followed by Quincy, Cambridge, and Revere.  
📌 **Ambulatory services dominate**, while inpatient admissions are the least frequent.  
📌 **Medicare is the top insurance provider** covering medical procedures.  
📌 **Unknown reason codes** suggest **inconsistent documentation of diagnoses**.  
📌 **Chronic conditions and hyperlipidemia** are among the most common diagnoses.  


## **Final Thoughts**  
This analysis provides **valuable insights** into patient demographics, hospital encounters, and financial trends. By leveraging Power BI, hospitals can enhance **decision-making, resource allocation, and patient care strategies**.
